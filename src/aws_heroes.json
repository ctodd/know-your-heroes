    "full_description": "Aidan is an avid AWS user, having first got started on the platform with EC2 in 2008. Fifteen years later, EC2 still has a special place in his heart, but his interests are in containers and serverless functions - and blurring the distinction between them wherever possible. He enjoys finding novel uses for AWS services, especially when they have a security or network focus. This is best demonstrated through his open source contributions on GitHub, where he demonstrates interesting use cases via hands-on projects.\n\nOne of Aidan’s favourite open source projects is perhaps the one that has the least real-world utility: Flowdog on GitHub. Though it’s something he expects no one will ever deploy, it demonstrates what’s made possible by the cloud, and he shares in the hope that it generates the same excitement for “imagine what we can build now” that he has when AWS launches new foundational services.\n\nAidan regularly shares his thoughts and new projects (sometimes useful, sometimes just for fun) on his blog, Twitter, and Mastodon accounts.",

    "full_description": "Luc is a well-known speaker and writer in the AWS Serverless community. He started his career in 2009 by founding Coding Dutchmen. They developed mobile apps for large sporting events such as the Tour de France and the Olympic Summer and Winter Games. These ventures laid the groundwork for Luc's specialisation in high-volume, mission-critical web infrastructures.\nIn 2017, Luc discovered AWS perfectly merged his dual passions: software development and web infrastructure. Infrastructure-as-Code allowed him to define his systems like the software he knew so well, and APIs and SDKs allowed him to scale infrastructure with the click of a button instead of a 3-month lead time for a server purchase.\nFrom 2021 onwards, Luc has focused on AWS Serverless, the current pinnacle of cloud maturity. Serverless allows developers to stop thinking about servers, networking, and (most of) the problems associated with scaling. These complex challenges are delegated to AWS, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of their applications. But using Serverless at scale requires a thorough understanding of common patterns, reliable integrations, and limits. Luc strives to help team members, colleagues, local and global AWS communities in embracing and growing these skill sets, so they too can experience the joy, fun and sheer scale Serverless brings to application development.",

More recently his efforts involve mentoring teams new to AWS and serverless, and helping them successfully adopt these technologies through training and education. Tom frequently shares his learnings on his blog, ServerlessOps. \nWhat drew Tom early to serverless was the prospect of having no hosts or container management platform to build and manage which yielded the question: What would he do if the servers he was responsible for went away? As an early DevOps adopter he felt it was time to take a leap again into a new and emerging technology space. He’s found enjoyment in a community of people that are both pushing the future of technology and trying to understand its effects on the future of people and businesses.\nOff the computer Tom races cars, dabbles in photography, sails, and is a devoted cat dad.",
